# Object-Based-Colour-Detection-Using-Open-CV
 This project is a Python script that captures video from a webcam in real-time and detects objects of different colors using the OpenCV library. The script applies color filtering based on predefined color ranges for various colors and then uses contour detection to identify and draw bounding boxes around objects of specific colors.
